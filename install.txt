To install Lightbox2 plugin for Mango, simply copy the lightbox2 folder into the folder:

MangoBlog/components/plugins/user

Then log into your administrator, go into Add-ons, and Activate Lightbox2.

Once active, Lightbox2 configures Mango's WYSIWYG post and page editor to allow
advanced linking. To activate lightbox, create a link, and set the setting
"Relationship page to target" (on the advanced tab) to "lightbox".


Manual configuration:

If for some reason the plugin will activate but the setup function won't run,
(or if you don't have an advanced tab when creating a new link), simply edit one file:

Edit line 16 of admin/editorSettings.cfm (for current version of Mango)
Edit line 30 of admin/layout.cfm (for older versions of Mango)

Change:
	plugins : "table,...

To:
	plugins : "table,advlink,...


** If you decide to de-activate Lightbox2 but the advanced link dialog does not go away,
edit the above file but *remove* the "advlink" item from the plugins list.
